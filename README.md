# Binaural Beat Generator

For making a sequence of binaural beats around a central frequency.  See the 'main' method and edit the variations and the central frequency parameter, then compile and run like:
```
javac BinauralBeats.16bit.java
java BinauralBeats
```

### Notes
I made this b/c the python version I built of it was too slow (about 6 seconds for 60 seconds of audio at 8bit samples at a 16k sample rate).  This java version is much faster.  However, It has been 7 years since I programmed in java, so there are a lot of beginner notes in the source.
